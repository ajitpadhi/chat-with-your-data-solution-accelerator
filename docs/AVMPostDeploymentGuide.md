## Overview

This guide covers what to do after you deploy Chat with Your Data. The infrastructure is built from Azure Verified Modules and provisioned by `azd up`, which creates the Container Apps environment, the three application containers (web app, backend API, and ingestion worker), Azure AI Foundry, and the storage and database resources. For a full walkthrough of the deployment itself, see [Deploy with azd](LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT.md).

By the time `azd up` finishes, two hooks have already run:

* **Post-provision** prepares the data platform, for example enabling the `pgvector` extension when you deploy in PostgreSQL mode.
* **Post-deploy** optionally seeds a sample scenario so chat works out of the box.

The steps below confirm the deployment, secure it, and add your own content.

## Prerequisites

* A successful `azd up` deployment. Run `azd env get-values` to see the outputs for your environment.
* Permission to configure the app's authentication and to grant admin-area access at the identity provider.

## Step 1: Confirm the deployment

Check the outputs for your environment and open the web app.

```bash
azd env get-values
```

Open the web app URL from the output in a browser. The chat page should load. If you seeded sample data during deployment, ask a question about it to confirm retrieval works.

## Step 2: Configure authentication

Restrict access so only authorized users can open the app.

1. Enable the built-in authentication on the web app's container app.
2. Follow [App authentication setup](authentication_setup.md) to configure the identity provider and restrict admin access to the people who manage content.

Administration lives inside the web app; there is no separate admin site. The admin area is served at `/admin` within the same app, and you control who can reach it at the identity provider or ingress layer rather than with an in-app role check. See [Admin and configuration](admin.md).

## Step 3: Ingest your documents

1. Sign in as a user authorized to reach the admin area, then open it.
2. On the **Ingest** page, upload documents or submit a URL. Sample documents are available under the `data/` directory of this repository.
3. The ingestion worker parses, chunks, embeds, and indexes the content. For how the pipeline works, see [Document ingestion](document_ingestion.md); for accepted formats, see [Supported file types](supported_file_types.md).

## Step 4: Test the chat experience

Open the chat page and ask a question about your uploaded content. The assistant answers with inline citations back to the source documents and streams a progress panel as it works. See [Streaming answers and citations](streaming_responses.md).

## Next steps

* **[Document ingestion](document_ingestion.md)**: understand how documents are processed and indexed.
* **[Admin and configuration](admin.md)**: ingest and manage documents from the built-in admin pages.
* **[Speech-to-text](speech_to_text.md)**: add voice interaction.
* **[Troubleshooting](TroubleShootingSteps.md)**: resolve common deployment errors.
