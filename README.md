# Chat with Your Data

Ground a conversational assistant in your own documents and get answers with inline citations back to the source.

Organizations hold vast unstructured knowledge in contracts, policies, product manuals, and benefit guides that is hard to search and slow to answer questions from. Chat with Your Data indexes that content and puts a natural-language chat experience in front of it, so people find grounded answers in seconds instead of digging through files. Everything deploys into your own Azure subscription with a single `azd up`.

```

The solution runs entirely on Azure Container Apps: a React single-page app, a FastAPI backend, and an Azure Functions ingestion worker. The backend calls Azure AI Foundry for models and retrieval, and reads and writes its index and chat history in either Azure AI Search with Cosmos DB or PostgreSQL with pgvector, chosen at deploy time. A user-assigned managed identity authorizes every call through Azure RBAC, so there is no Key Vault and there are no application secrets to manage.

### How it works

You ask a question in natural language. The backend retrieves the most relevant passages from your indexed documents, grounds a language model on that context, and streams the answer back to the browser with inline citations to the source documents. Ingestion runs separately: documents you upload or web pages you point at are parsed, chunked, embedded, and written to the retrieval index, ready for the next question.

### Additional resources

- [Azure AI Foundry documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/)
- [Azure Container Apps documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/)
- [Azure Functions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/)
- [Azure Developer CLI (azd) documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/)

## Key features

- **Grounded answers with citations**: responses are grounded in your indexed content and cite the source documents inline.
- **Document ingestion pipeline**: upload files or index public web pages; the pipeline parses, chunks, and embeds many [file types](docs/supported_file_types.md).
- **Database flexibility**: choose Azure AI Search with Cosmos DB or PostgreSQL with pgvector at deploy time.
- **Managed-identity security**: a single user-assigned managed identity and Azure RBAC, with no Key Vault and no application secrets. See [Managed identity and RBAC](docs/managed_identity.md).
- **Conversational web app**: a single-page chat interface with streaming responses and persistent [chat history](docs/chat_history.md).
- **Admin and configuration surface**: ingest, inspect, and configure your dataset and prompts from the built-in [admin experience](docs/admin.md).
- **Speech-to-text input**: ask questions by voice with [speech-to-text](docs/speech_to_text.md).

## Deploy

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Azure subscription | With rights to create resources and role assignments (Owner, or Contributor plus User Access Administrator). [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). |
| Azure Developer CLI (azd) | Version `>= 1.18.0` (and not `1.23.9`). [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd). |
| Azure CLI (az) | Used for sign-in and supporting commands. [Install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). |
| Docker | Required for local development. Not required for `azd up`, which builds the container images remotely. [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). |
| Model capacity | Deploy to a region with Azure AI Foundry model capacity. Check availability first with the [quota check](docs/QuotaCheck.md) and [model quota settings](docs/azure_openai_model_quota_settings.md) guides. |

### Deploy with azd

`azd up` is the only supported deployment path. From the repository root:

```bash
azd auth login
azd up
```

`azd up` provisions the infrastructure, builds and pushes the container images, deploys the three services, and seeds the sample corpus. It prompts you for:

- Environment name, target Azure subscription, and deployment location.
- Database engine: `cosmosdb` (Cosmos DB with Azure AI Search) or `postgresql` (PostgreSQL with pgvector). This choice is locked after deploy.
- Azure AI service location: the region for Azure AI Foundry models.
- Optional hardening flags: monitoring, scalability, redundancy, and private networking.

When it finishes, `azd` prints the application URL. For the full walkthrough, prerequisites, and post-deployment verification, see the [deployment guide](docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT.md). To change parameters before deploying, see [Customizing azd parameters](docs/customizing_azd_parameters.md).

### Costs

This accelerator deploys several billable services. Estimate cost with the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) and review the per-service pricing below.

| Service | Purpose | Pricing |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Azure Container Apps | Hosts the web app, backend API, and ingestion worker. | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/) |
| Azure Container Registry | Stores the container images the workload pulls. | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-registry/) |
| Azure AI Foundry | Chat, embedding, and retrieval models. | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/) |
| Azure AI Search | Retrieval index in `cosmosdb` mode. | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/) |
| Azure Document Intelligence | Parses uploaded documents. | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ai-document-intelligence/) |
| Azure Storage | Stores ingestion blobs and processing queues. | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/) |
| Azure Functions | Runs the ingestion pipeline. | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/) |
| Azure Cosmos DB or PostgreSQL | Chat history and, in `postgresql` mode, the index. | [Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cosmos-db/), [PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/postgresql/flexible-server/) |
| Azure AI Speech | Speech-to-text input. | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/) |
| Application Insights | Optional monitoring and diagnostics. | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Resources continue to incur charges until you delete them. Run `azd down` when you are finished to avoid ongoing costs.

### Clean up

### Security

Chat with Your Data authenticates to Azure with a single user-assigned managed identity, and every downstream call is authorized through Azure RBAC. There is no Key Vault and there are no application secrets to store or rotate. See [Managed identity and RBAC](docs/managed_identity.md) for the identity model and role assignments.

- Keep secret scanning enabled on your fork so credentials are never committed.
- For stricter isolation, enable the private-networking hardening flag at deploy time to place data-plane resources behind a virtual network and private endpoints.
- Consider Microsoft Defender for Cloud for continuous posture monitoring.

## Legacy release

An earlier release of this accelerator lives under [`cwyd-v1/`](cwyd-v1/). It used a different hosting model and a one-click deployment button in the Azure portal, and is retained for reference only. New deployments should use the `azd up` flow described above.
